- **No griefing** - do not destroy, steal, or alter another player's builds without permission
- **Respect other players **- Be kind, no harassment, bullying, or toxic chat
- **No cheating** - this includes hacked clients, x-ray texture packs, item duping, or any exploit that gives unfair advantages
- **Play fair with resources** - Don't strip-mine areas near someone's base without asking
- **No stealing **- Items in chests, barrels, or shulker boxes belong to their owner unless given or traded
- **Keep chat friendly** - No excessive swearing, spam, or offensive content
- **Respect Admin decisions** - Staff have the final say in disputes
- **No random mass destruction **- Avoid leaving giant holes, floating trees, or ugly terrain scars
- **Mob Farms** - no mob, block, or farm at this time.
- **Spawns must be appropriate** - any offensive builds will be removed and are a banable offence
