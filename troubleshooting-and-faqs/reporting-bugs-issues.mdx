# **Overview**

Hello! Thank you for your interest in reporting bugs for TrilogyMC's Java Minecraft server and network.

Bugs can occur with any server or network, regardless of how thoroughly our small team tests it. We appreciate players like you, as your feedback helps us identify issues that we may not have anticipated.

We, the team at TrilogyMC, sincerely appreciate your dedication as a bug reporter! Before you submit a bug report via the bugs forum, please keep a few important things in mind.

## **Tracking Bugs**

All submitted bugs are initially assigned a default status of `New`. As our development team works on the bugs, their status may change to reflect the current stage of processing, as outlined below:

- **In Progress:** The issue is currently being investigated or actively worked on.
- **Resolved:** The problem has been fixed and is ready for testing.
- **Closed:** The issue has been verified and is functioning as intended.
- **Duplicate:** This report has been identified as a duplicate of an existing bug submitted by another player.
- **Won't Fix:** This behavior is intentional or is not considered an issue.

## **Submitting Bugs**

1. Ensure that your title is clear and to the point. Titles must be a minimum of 70 characters long.
2. Provide as much information as possible; short and vague reports will not be accepted.
3. Adhere to the format we provide for report submissions, as it is designed to help you present a clear and detailed report for our development team.
4. Use clear and correct grammar when writing your reports.
5. Include screenshots, videos, logs, or steps for reproducing the issue. Acceptable formats for submissions are:
   1. Screenshots: PNG, JPG, JPEG
   2. Videos: MP4, MOV, WEBM, AVI, FLV, WMV, MKV, MPG, MPEG, M4V, 3GP, 3G2
