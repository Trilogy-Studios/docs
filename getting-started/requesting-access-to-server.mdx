Thank you for your interest in joining TrilogyMC!

To request access to our community and server, please follow these simple steps:

1. Join our Discord using this [link](https://discord.gg/ppxKAVMZ2f).
2. Complete our membership application found [here](https://tally.so/r/nrRL5R).
3. After you submit your application, our team will review it and reach out to you for an interview through the üìù‚îÉawaiting-interview [channel](https://discord.com/channels/1380267943690109039/1408168448114298941) in our Discord.

<Info>
  **Note:** Once your application has been accepted and your interview completed, you will be whitelisted on our network. After being whitelisted, you can join our server following the next server restart.

<Warning>
  Due to factors beyond our control, whitelisting must be done manually. We apologize for the inconvenience and are actively seeking solutions to resolve this limitation soon.
