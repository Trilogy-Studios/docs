To play on the TrilogyMC community server, you must own a Minecraft account for PC/Mac (also known as the Java version).

The TrilogyMC server IP address is: **play.trilogymc.net**

Any other versions, such as Windows 10/11, Pocket Edition, or Console versions, will not work. Pirated copies will be blocked.

## How to join the TrilogyMC Server

You'll need to purchase a Minecraft account (if you don't have one already) and download Minecraft (remember, we only support Java at this time), which can be done from the [official Minecraft website](https://minecraft.net/).

Once installed and ready to play, you can join the TrilogyMC server by adding it to your multiplayer server list.
