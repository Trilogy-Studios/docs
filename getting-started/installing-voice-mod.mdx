To use Simple Voice Chat (Proximity Voice Chat) within our server, you will need to install the plugin as a client-side modification. To do this, please follow the guide step by step. Once completed, you will be ready to go!

<Info>
  In this guide, we will install the Fabric version of the Simple Voice Chat plugin. If you're open to using Fabric, please continue reading. For other platforms, review their documentation.

## **Setting up the Fabric Loader & API**

Navigate to the Fabric Loader [<u>website </u>](https://fabricmc.net/)and download the latest version by clicking the big blue **Download **button.

![Shows the Fabric Loader's website with a red rectangle outline around a blue button that says "Download".](/images/Installingvoicemod1.png)

Once downloaded, double click the downloaded file and await for a menu to pop-up.

It will then ask you to choose a Minecraft version. Choose whichever version you want. This will be important to note further in this guide.

<Note>
  Our server uses 1.21.10 by default, but does allow other version, choose that or a version or two above.
</Note>

The installer will automatically locate your Minecraft launcher's location.

Once that is set, leave everything else alone and check on the "Create profile" option before pressing "Install".

Exit the installer program and launch your Minecraft launcher. You should now see a new profile added to your launcher, Fabric Loader, with the version number beside it. If you see that, you are good to go!

Next up, in the top left, click on "Installations" and then hover to the right of the Fabric Loader profile. You'll notice a folder icon, click on that, and it will take you to your installation folder.

In the installations folder, you'll also see a `mod` folder. That is where that Simple Voice Chat plugin will go, but before you can do that, you need to install the Fabric API.

Go to [<u>Modrinth </u>](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)and download the Fabric API plugin for the version you are using in your newly created Fabric Loader profile.

![Shows a red rectangle outline over the "Download" button on the Fabric API plugin page on Modrinth.com.](/images/Installingvoicemod9.png)

![Displays a pop-up that allows you to choose the game version and platform to download the plugin or install it with the Modrinth app.](/images/Installingvoicemod10.png)

To download it from Modrinth, click on the green **Download **button, select the game version that matches with your recently installed Fabric Loader, and await for it to download.

Once it is downloaded, copy and paste it into your mods folder.

## **Install Simple Voice Chat**

After, go and grab the Simple Voice Chat plugin from Modrinth. Click the green **Download** button, choose the Minecraft version you chose when installing the Fabric Loader, and choose Fabric within the platform. Then hit the **Download **button again and wait for it to download to your computer.

![This section of the pop-up gives you two download buttons; one with an "R" for release or "B" for beta. Choose the release version.](/images/Installingvoicemod15.png)

Then add that newly downloaded plugin to the mods folder that we opened up before in installations.

<Tip>
  Stick to versions that are release or "R" based when downloading the plugin. Stay away from beta or "B" at this time, please.
</Tip>
